# Mandatory Team Repository Standard

Each approved team must create its own GitHub repository.

## Repository Name

```text
MTL-DA-005-<team-name>
```

Example:

```text
MTL-DA-005-compliance-insight-lab
```

## Visibility

The repository may remain private during delivery.

If private, add the designated Mettelo reviewer GitHub account before final submission.

## Mandatory Mettelo Access

Every team delivery repository **must grant Mettelo access** for review, verification and project-quality assurance.

### If the repository is owned by a team member or another organisation

The Team Lead must invite the **designated Mettelo reviewer GitHub account** as a collaborator.

### If the repository is created inside the Mettelo GitHub organisation

The required Mettelo reviewer/team access must be retained.

### Submission rule

A repository will **not be treated as a complete Mettelo submission until Mettelo access has been granted and verified**.

The Team Lead is responsible for ensuring that:

- the invitation has been sent;
- the designated Mettelo reviewer can open the repository;
- the reviewer can inspect code, documentation, issues, pull requests and contribution history;
- access remains available throughout review and verification.

Do not remove Mettelo access until the project review and verification process is complete.

## README Requirements

The root README must contain:

- project ID/title;
- team name;
- members/roles;
- business-problem summary;
- solution overview;
- data acquisition instructions;
- architecture/data-flow summary;
- reproduction steps;
- dashboard link;
- deliverable links;
- limitations;
- source attribution.

## Git Workflow

Minimum expectations:

- issues for meaningful work;
- descriptive commits;
- branches for substantial changes;
- pull requests for material merges;
- peer review where practical;
- visible contribution from team members.

Do not upload the entire project in one final commit.

## Data Rules

Do not manually modify raw source data.

If automated extraction is used, keep the extraction process reproducible.

## Reproducibility

A technically competent reviewer must be able to reconstruct the analytical workflow from the repository instructions.

## Contribution Evidence

`CONTRIBUTIONS.md` must record actual individual contributions.

Commit count alone is not sufficient proof of contribution.
